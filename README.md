Q-SOS â€“ an extension of the OGC's Sensor Observation Service (SOS 1.0) that supports retrieval of observation data together with quality descriptions. These descriptions are represented in an observation data model covering various aspects of data quality assessment. The service and the data model are productively being used to share observation data from the [TERENO](http://teodoor.icg.kfa-juelich.de) observatory infrastructure.
